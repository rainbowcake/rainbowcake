[**RainbowCake**](https://rainbowcake.github.io/) is an Android architecture framework, providing tools and guidance for building modern Android applications. It builds on top of Jetpack, both in terms of code and ideas.

Some of the main goals of this architecture:

- Give guidance on all aspects of the application, covering not just the View architecture,
- Clearly separate concerns between different layers and components,
- Always keep views in a safe and consistent state with ViewModels,
- Handle configuration changes (and even process death) gracefully,
- Make offloading work to background threads trivial.


While RainbowCake is heavily opinionated, it also encourages you to deviate from it as needed. Feel free to pick and choose the ideas and library artifacts provided according to your own applicationâ€™s needs!

For more information, see the official documentation on [**rainbowcake.dev**](https://rainbowcake.github.io/).

> **Note:** RainbowCake is stable and maintained, but it's a framework from 2019, so browse and use it with that in mind. You'll find a lot of the same ideas in Google's official [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) as well, which is updated more actively.
